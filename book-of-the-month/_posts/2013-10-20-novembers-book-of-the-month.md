Hello again, Marfs!  It's that time again--time to announce the new book.  While I can't say this one has much to do with November, it's going to be a fun one (especially after a horror novel).  Drumroll, please!

The November book is *Redshirts* by John Scalzi!

John Scalzi is a celebrated modern sci-fi writer and Internet person of note, first hitting the literary scene in 2005 with the first installment of the *Old Man's War* series (of which three of the novels have been nominated for Hugo awards).  He also runs a Hugo-award winning blog called [Whatever](http://whatever.scalzi.com/), and was a creative consultant on the show *Stargate Universe*.

*Redshirts* itself won the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and is a parable of those loveable expendables, the red shirts.  Running the line somewhere between hard sci-fi and *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead*, it poses the biggest question all of us sci-fi lovers have wondered: do the red shirts realise what they're getting themselves into?

So get ready to boldly go where no furry has gone before!  ...Oh, wait.  I can't...I can't say that?  Uh...well, bring your space suit and get ready for a little mystery, a little conspiracy, and a lot of red.

To purchase *Reshirts*, you can try [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Redshirts-A-Novel-Three-Codas/dp/0765334798/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382235879&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=redshirts+john+scalzi), [Barnes &amp; Noble](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/redshirts-john-scalzi/1107085800?ean=9780765334794), [Audible](http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Redshirts-Audiobook/B007SP2LPM/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1382235896&amp;sr=1-1) (read by Wil Wheaton!!!), or try your local library or bookstore.

Happy reading (and live long and Bookmarf)!
