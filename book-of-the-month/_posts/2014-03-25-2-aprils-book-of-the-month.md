All right, ladies, gents, and those undefined.  We're roaring right into April, and it's time to announce a new book.  Partly in honour of [Biggest Little Fur Con](http://www.biggestlittlefurcon.org/), and partly because we want to barrel back into your hearts and minds like woah, our choice for April is...

*Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* by Hunter S. Thompson.

...Okay, get all the *CSI* jokes out now.  We can wait.

...

...

All better?  All right!

What is there to say about this book, this *author*, that hasn't been said a million times before?  Not much, or maybe too much.  Whatever the way, Hunter S. Thompson would not want you to know.  Or he would.  In fact, he'd not only want you to know, he'd want you to dive right in and become what you want to know.  That is the main tenet of Thompson's works--Gonzo journalism, inserting oneself so deeply into their topic, into the action of their research that they become the central figure of the story itself.

Y'see, there's embedded journalists, and then there's Hunter S. Thompson.  In *Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs*, Thompson didn't just research the Hell's Angels--he lived and rode with them for a year.  He became that which he wanted to write about.  It's not a style of writing for the faint of heart, but Thompson influenced the way journalism could even be thought of, much less written like.

*Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* is, debatably, his most iconic work, if not just for the Terry Gilliam-directed 1998 flick.  A prime example of the blurred line of fact and fiction inherent in gonzo journalism, *Fear and Loathing* is a mad, drug-addled descent into the failure of the American Dream in the early 70s.  It's as much about its protagonist (a thinly-veiled caricature of Thompson himself) and his cohort trying to find the forsaken America as it is about the very act of searching it out in the first place.

So grab your cigarettes, tug along your cactus, and get ready--because this is Bat Country, and we can't stop.
