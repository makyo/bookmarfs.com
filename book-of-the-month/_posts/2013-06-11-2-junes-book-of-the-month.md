Announcing our first book choice for Bookmarfs!

*Fledgling* by Octavia Butler.

Octavia Butler was an award-winning and renowned science fiction author, and was one of the best-known African-American writers in the sci-fi genre.  Over the course of her career, she wrote books for three series (*Patternist*, *Lilith's Brood*, and *Parable*), along with one other stand-alone novel, *Kindred*.  All of her books have underlying themes of race, sexuality, identity, and community.

From the back of *Fledgling**:*

> Shori is a mystery.  Found alone in the woods, she appears to be a little black girl with traumatic amnesia and near-fatal wounds.  But Shori is a fifty-three-year-old vampire with a ravenous hunger for blood, the lost child of an ancient species of near-immortals who live in dark symbiosis with humanity.  Genetically modified to be able to walk in daylight, Shori now becomes a target of a vast plot to destroy her and her kind.  And in the final apocalyptic battle, her survival will depend on whether all humans are bigots--or all bigots are human....

*Fledgling* is not a vampire book for the *Twilight* crowd.  It is a novel that discusses personal conflict, community vs. the individual, and bigotry in a big way--all without being hamfisted.  We at Bookmarfs chose this as the first novel for two reasons: one, it's not so well-known as everyone would have read it already; and two, it has weight.  We wanted to start off with something that was both entertaining and exciting, but not without literary and intellectual merit.

I hope you'll all join us in reading *Fledgling*.  Even if it's not your normal genre, give it a spin--what've you got to lose?
