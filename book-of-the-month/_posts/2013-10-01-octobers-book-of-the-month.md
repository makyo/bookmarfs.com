Hey marfs!  We’re back from our short hiatus, and ready for another book!  It’s October, the time of ghouls and goblins, so what better way to celebrate than with a 20th century classic of terror.

This month’s book is *The Haunting of Hill House* by Shirley Jackson.

Shirley Jackson is most well-known for her short story "The Lottery", about a New England town which hides a sinister ritual.  This theme, the bucolic underscored by the dark and disturbed, is prevalent in all of Jackson’s work, and ahead of her time not just for 20th century horror writing but for 20th century female writers as well.

The Haunting of Hill House is no deep cut, either--it’s been adapted into two movies and one stage play, and is considered one of the finest works of horror in the 20th century.  Stephen King, among other horror and macabre powerhouse writers, considers both the book and the author one of the best around, showing just how culturally relevant her themes, ideas, and writing are.

So cuddle up to your black cat, and be nice to the baba yaga--it’s the month of Halloween, and we’re diving into a touchstone horror novel.  We hope you join us in reading *The Haunting of Hill House* this month.
