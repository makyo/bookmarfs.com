Hey marfs!  August is upon us, and so it's time to move on to our next book!  This month is a non-fiction month.

This month's book is *Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex* by Mary Roach.

Mary Roach is an author specializing in popular science.  She has published books on the intersection of science and cadavers, science and the afterlife, science and eating, and just plain old science.  She also writes book reviews for the New York Times, serves on the Mars Institute's advisory board, and is even a member of the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary!

From *Bonk*'s [webpage](http://www.maryroach.net/bonk.html):

> The study of sexual physiology—what happens, and why, and how to make it happen better—has been going on for centuries, behind the closed doors of laboratories, brothels, Alfred Kinsey's attic, and, more recently, MRI centers, pig farms, and sex-toy R&amp;D labs.  I spent two years wheedling  and conniving my way behind those doors to bring you the answers to the questions Dr. Ruth never asked.  Is your penis three inches longer than you think? Is vaginal orgasm a myth?  Can a dead man get an erection? Why doesn't Viagra help women—or, for that matter, pandas?

Science, sex, and humor make for an excellent combination in this book, with topics ranging from those who study sex to actually being a participant in such a study, from how orgasms work to the lasting myths about copulation.  We hope you'll join us in reading *Bonk* this month!
