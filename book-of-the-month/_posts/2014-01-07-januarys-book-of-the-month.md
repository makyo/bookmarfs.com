Is this thing on?

Hello, Marfs! Sorry for the...delayed post. Holidays are a doozy, but we here at Bookmarfs you all got everything you could have wanted and more! It better have been books. Lots of books, Marfers.

All right, down to business! January is upon us, which means a new book. After the whimsical adventures of September in Fairyland, we decided to keep up the theme of dreaming. Just in a...decidedly more adult direction. January's book is:

*The Lathe of Heaven* by Ursula K. Le Guin.

What is there to say about Ursula K. Le Guin that hasn't been said one million times already about her?  She has won just about every award a science fiction/fantasy writer can win, multiple times over--five Locus, four Nebula, two Hugo, and one World Fantasy Award, among countless other commendations from all corners of the literary and philanthropic world.  Her works have been adapted countless times into movies, operas, and plays.  As one of the first feminist writers in science fiction/fantasy, Le Guin also quickly broke down the door for other female writers afterward, along with less traditional ideas of what science fiction and fantasy could discuss.

*The Lathe of Heaven *is one of Le Guin's most beloved works, second only to either *The Left Hand of Darkness* or the *Earthsea* books.  A book about dreams and power, about a man who is lost between what is real and what is merely created by his own psyche.  Throughout all of Le Guin's writing, themes of the self versus society, of perception versus reality, and of power versus control abound, and *The Lathe of Heaven* is a deep discussion on these and more.

This is not a light book, but it's not the first heavy book we'e read here!  We're very excited to be reading this with you all, excited to have a discussion on it, and excited to disseminate it into the fandom a little, even just a little, by our doing.  So please, come join us for a dive into one of the greatest authors of the 20th century.
