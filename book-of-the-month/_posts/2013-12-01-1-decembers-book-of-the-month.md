Happy holidays, Marfs!  'Tis the season for chestnuts on fires, spiked eggnog, and reading!  This month, we're gonna give you a twofer--a book you can read and enjoy, and a present you can give to someone this season.  December's book is:

*The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making* by Catherynne M. Valente.

Catherynne Valente is a modern fantasy author powerhouse, having won the Tiptree, Andre Norton, and Mythopoeic Awards for her novels and poetry, along with the Lambda Award for GLBT Science Fiction or Fantasy for her novel *Palimpsest*.

*The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland* is also the first crowdfunded novel to win a major literary award, and is the start in a (current) trilogy of novels.  The book follows September, a 12-year-old girl in Omaha, Nebraska.  Her parents have both left to help the wartime cause, and September's adventure begins when a Green Wind arrives and whisks her off to Fairyland.  But why did we decide to read a young adult novel?

Not only is Catherynne Valente an amazing author whose themes of identity, personal discovery, and personal heroism ring true in not just the fandom but also in everyone's lives--

Not only does the book brim with adult humour about bureaucrats, drudgery, and the same sorts of jokes classic authors like Baum and Carroll would have made--

But we figured that once everyone is done reading the book, you could gift it to a niece or nephew you're going to see during the holidays!  Pass on good, challenging, and fun literature.\*

So, put on your favourite ugly Christmas sweater (you know the one), snuggle up with some hot cocoa, and get ready for a modern fairy tale in *The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making*.

To purchase *The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland*, you can try [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Circumnavigated-Fairyland-Ship-Making/dp/1250010195), [Barnes &amp; Noble](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/girl-who-circumnavigated-fairyland-in-a-ship-of-her-own-making-catherynne-m-valente/1100162358?ean=9781250010193), [Audible](http://www.audible.com/pd/Teens/The-Girl-Who-Circumnavigated-Fairyland-in-a-Ship-of-Her-Own-Making-Audiobook/B004Y71H2A/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srImg?qid=1385917186&amp;sr=1-1) (read by the author herself!), or your local library!
