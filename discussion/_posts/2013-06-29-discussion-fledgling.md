Howdy, marfs!  This month, we read the book <em>Fledgling</em> by Octavia Butler, a story exploring identity, and the ways in which two cultures, one vampire, one human, interact.

<s>If you have finished the book by the time the discussion starts, feel free to join us in the hangout</s>!  If you do not want to join on the video call but would still like to join in the discussion, you may do so by mentioning @bookmarfs on twitter, commenting here, or joining the #bookmarfs IRC channel on Anthrochat or Furnet.  Remember, we'll be talking about the book from start to finish, so it will be hard to avoid spoilers; just something to keep in mind! Hangout tips:
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">If you're not talking, it's a good idea to mute yourself.  You can click on the microphone in the upper left corner, or hit Ctrl+d</span></li>
<li>If someone forgets to mute themselves and you can hear typing, munching, dogs howling, or whatever, you can mute them - if you get muted, remember it's not intended as a slight, we're just staying focused!</li>
<li>Hangouts will try to focus on whoever is talking at the time, so try not to talk over others too much!</li>
<li>If you are participating in the hangout, <em>please leave this page or mute the video</em>.  The broadcast runs a few seconds behind, and it will echo terribly!</li>
</ul>
