**Note!  The date of the discussion has changed!**

Bookmarfs! will be having its second discussion this coming **Saturday the 10th of August at 2PM Pacific / 5PM Eastern / 9PM UTC**.  We will be discussing our book of the month for July, [Haruki Murakami's *Kafka on the Shore*](http://bookmarfs.com/2013/06/julys-book-of-the-month-kafka-on-the-shore-by-haruki-murakami/).  Here's a little bit about how the whole process will work:

We'll be scheduling a Google+ Hangout On Air soon.  Google+ Hangouts are a type of video conferencing system that allows users to run a discussion or meeting in a natural fashion.  The On Air feature allows users to watch the hangout live (or, well, with a slight delay), as well has have the entire thing automatically posted on YouTube after the fact.  This is good news for those of you who can't make the actual event itself, as you'll still be able to see the entirety of the discussion.  Several, if not all, of the panel members will be there in the hangout, and any additional spots (up to ten) will be first-come-first-serve for anyone else - that's right, you can join in the discussion with us!  Though we ask that if you do wish to join the hangout, that you have finished the book and be willing to take an active part in the discussion :o)

In addition to the G+ Hangout, we'll be watching both twitter and IRC in order to accommodate as many folk as possible.  You can @mention us on Twitter with any questions you have about the book or any points you'd like to make and we'll do our best to address them in the hangout.  At least some of us will be in #bookmarfs on IRC (both [Anthrochat](http://anthrochat.net) and [Furnet](http://furnet.org)) for those who would like to join us there.  Again, we'll bring up points and questions we see in channel in the hangout as we can.

The general structure of the hangout will be pretty simple and open-ended.  In order to keep the time down (our first discussion ran pretty long!), we'll try to come up with a limited number of points to talk about beforehand, and aim to keep the discussion between forty-five minutes and an hour.  Here's the basic structure:

* Intro to Bookmarfs - about the club
* Introductions - a sentence or two about each of us
* Introduce the book - brief synopsis/blurb type thing
* Go around everyone in the hangout for a brief summary of their experience with the book - what they liked, what they didn't like, etc.
* Discussion on the book - keep an eye on IRC/twitter/email to include discussion from others
* Wrap up with tie-ins to furry
* Conclude with next month's book - brief synopsis/blurb type thing

We're looking forward to hanging out and marfin' 'bout books with all of you keeping up with us!

Yay marfs!
