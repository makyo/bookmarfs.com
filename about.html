<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p>The Marfs are a loose collection of furries hooked on reading. Back in 2013, they banded together to create Bookmarfs! as a way to share the books that they enjoyed, and to talk through the ones that they didn't. From there, Bookmarfs! as a club was born, with the goal of reading a book a month and having an hour (at least) discussion about them after, live-streamed for any and all comers.</p>

<p>Bookmarfs! was the brainchild of Lunostophiles. Other original Marfs include Makyo, Peri, Forneus, Tabbie, and AC Fox, with many more showing up here and there.</p>

<h3>What books do we read?</h3>

<p>We read books of all sorts! Prior to our hiatus, we read:
<ul>
<li><em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em> by Hunter S. Thompson
<li><em>The Seventh Chakra</em> by Kevin Frane
<li><em>The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making</em> by Catherynne Valente
<li><em>Redshirts</em> by John Scalzi
<li><em>The Haunting of Hill House</em> by Shirley Jackson
<li><em>Bonk</em> by Mary Roach
<li><em>Kafka on the Shore</em> by Haruki Murakami
<li><em>Fledgling</em> by Octavia Butler
</ul>
</p>

<p>There are some furry books, some fiction, some non-fiction (and <em>Fear and Loathing</em> which can't make up its mind), and all sorts of genres. Our goal with the monthly book is to get something not everyone has read and have a chance to work through it. What about it works? What doesn't? What did we like and dislike? How does it work for us as furries?</p>

<p>The monthly books aren't all we read, either. Small groups and individuals can read books and come up with their own discussions, or even do some write-ups (called Wags).</p>

<h3>When does this take place?</h3>

<p>Monthly book chats will take place every month, natch. Books will be decided before the month they're to be read in a chat somewhere *vague handwaving*</p>

<p>Outside of the monthly chats, Bookmarfs! is continual. There's always books to be read, and always yaps to be had about them! To that end, the locations are...</p>

<h3>Where...?</h3>

<p>Bookmarfs! inhabits a Telegram chat and a Goodreads group, places that we can call our own. These are both free to join and a good place for talking about both the monthly books, as well as any ol' book you come across. Smaller sub-groups and individual projects are both smiled beatifically upon, and encouraged to turn into the write-ups we call Wags.</p>

<p>As we've struggled in the past with keeping from getting overrun by spam, both of these locations are currently private, though will be given out to any earnest seeker who asks.</p>

<h3>Why a furry book club?</h3>

<p>There are a lot of furry books. A loooot of them. But they're not the only books that furries read, we read all sorts of things! We want to celebrate that folks within the subculture are reading for enjoyment or hunting for meaning just as much as those outside the subculture.</p>

<h3>So how do I do this?</h3>

<p>Stay tuuuuned.</p>
